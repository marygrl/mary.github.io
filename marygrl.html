<h2>About Me</h2>
<p align = "justify">I am a second year undergraduate student at Rutgers University New Brunswick School of Engineering and Honors College. I am pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I am looking to further concentrate in Intelligence and Cybersecurity.
<br>I am always curious and willing to put my creativity forward. I take great pride in my work and respobsilities, always completely projects in a timely, organized manner. My dedication and love for engineering is what pushes me to want to succeed and go the extra step further in my career. I have experience working in the Information Technology field at Computero Inc. In college, I have taken courses where I have developed skills like Java, Matlab, and AutoDesk.</p>

<h2>STEM for Women</h2>
<p align = "justify">As a woman in engineering, I firmly believe that involving younger girls in science, tech, engineering, and mathematics is such an important mission. When I was a girl growing up, I always had a passion for math, which evolved into my love for computers, coding, and engineering. I had a great support system from my family and high school teachers, and was fortunate to have resources to foster my learning. I would love to share this same encouragement and education to younger girls in STEM, so I started an initiative called STEM for Women.
<br>STEM for Women is a social media-based initiative, run through Instagram and a blog, meant to educate and inspire young girls and non-binary students in STEM. Gaining almost 500 followers, the STEM for Women Instagram account includes informative posts about topics in engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, and more. I run this account with STEM news, education, and encouragement in mind.
<br>My love for this project pushed me to get involved with other organizations dedicated to the same cause on the Rutgers University campus. I am a sister of the Alpha Omega Epsilon STEM Sorority, where we value leadership, friendship, and professionalism. I am also a member of SWE, the Society of Women Engineers. Beyond that, as an Honors College student, I am a member of the Rutgers Engineering Honors Council, a small group of honors engineers whose goal is to bring together and educate the honors community.
