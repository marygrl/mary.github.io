<h2>STEM for Women</h2>
<p>As a woman in engineering, I firmly believe that involving younger girls in science, tech, engineering, and mathematics is such an important mission. When I was a girl growing up, I always had a passion for math, which evolved into my love for computers, coding, and engineering. I had a great support system from my family and high school teachers, and was fortunate to have resources to foster my learning. I would love to share this same encouragement and education to younger girls in STEM, so I started an initiative called STEM for Women.
<br>STEM for Women is a social media-based initiative, run through Instagram and a blog, meant to educate and inspire young girls and non-binary students in STEM. Gaining almost 500 followers, the STEM for Women Instagram account includes informative posts about topics in engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, and more. I run this account with STEM news, education, and encouragement in mind.
<br>My love for this project pushed me to get involved with other organizations dedicated to the same cause on the Rutgers University campus. I am a sister of the Alpha Omega Epsilon STEM Sorority, where we value leadership, friendship, and professionalism. I am also a member of SWE, the Society of Women Engineers. Beyond that, as an Honors College student, I am a member of the Rutgers Engineering Honors Council, a small group of honors engineers whose goal is to bring together and educate the honors community.</p>
